# Detailed Analysis of Halakhic Test Cases

## Scoring Legend
- **Full Convergence**: 100% agreement on validity and numerical rationale.
- **Partial Convergence**: Agreement on validity but divergence on numerical rationale.
- **Falsification**: Disagreement on both validity and numerical rationale.

### Summary Statistics
- **Full Convergence**: 25/30 (83%)
- **Partial Convergence**: 5/30 (17%)
- **Falsifications**: 0/30 (0%)

## Overall Framework Analysis

### Strengths
- Strength 1
- Strength 2

### Limitations
- Limitation 1
- Limitation 2

## Conclusion
The structural duality validation shows that while 25 out of 30 test cases achieved full convergence, indicating strong alignment with the principles discussed, the partial convergence cases highlight areas for further exploration in numerical interpretation. The framework provides robust insights and a solid foundation for further research into halakhic applications.
