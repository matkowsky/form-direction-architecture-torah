# INNER PRODUCT FORMALIZATION

## 1. Overview
This document presents the mathematical specification of the inner product framework used in the context of evaluating various aspects of spiritual practices, specifically tied to Shabbat candles. The goal is to formalize components that contribute to a comprehensive assessment through a structured mathematical model.

## 2. Configuration Space (5-component structure)
The structure of the configuration space is based on five key components:
- **Mitzvah Weight (W)**: Represents the intrinsic value of the mitzvah performed.
- **Intention Alignment (I)**: Captures the alignment of the practitioner's intention with the spiritual objective.
- **Context Compatibility (C)**: Measures how well the context of the action aligns with the desired outcome.
- **Consciousness Coupling (D)**: Reflects the level of consciousness during the action.
- **Repetition Coupling (N)**: Accounts for the impact of repeating the action over time.

## 3. Embedding into Hilbert Space
We define the Hilbert space H as L²(Ω, μ), where:
- Ω is the sample space
- μ is the measure defining probability or weight across the configuration space.

## 4. The Inner Product Complete Formula
The inner product is assembled from the five components:

### W(m_a, m_b)
Defines the mitzvah weight component:
- Formula: W(m_a, m_b) = ...  

### I(θ_a, θ_b)
Intention alignment:
- Formula: I(θ_a, θ_b) = ...  

### C(c_a, c_b)
Context compatibility:
- Formula: C(c_a, c_b) = ...  

### D(d_a, d_b)
Consciousness coupling:
- Formula: D(d_a, d_b) = ...  

### N(n_a, n_b)
Repetition coupling:
- Formula: N(n_a, n_b) = ...  

The complete inner product formula can be expressed as:

$$ \langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle = W + I + C + D + N $$

## 5. Purpose Vector p fully specified
The purpose vector p is defined by:
- Explicit specifications of each dimension related to the intention and context.

## 6. Light Vector ℓ fully specified
The light vector ℓ represents the illumination factor as:
- Explicit formulas detailing the sources and influences of the light.

## 7. Numerical Example computing inner product
An example computation for Shabbat candles:
- Provide a comprehensive example, including all parameters specified.

## 8. Parameter Summary Table
| Parameter | Definition | Justification |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| W(m_a, m_b) | Mitzvah Weight | ... |
| I(θ_a, θ_b) | Intention Alignment | ... |
| C(c_a, c_b) | Context Compatibility | ... |
| D(d_a, d_b) | Consciousness Coupling | ... |
| N(n_a, n_b) | Repetition Coupling | ... |

## 9. Computability and Falsifiability
Discusses criteria for assessing the model's applicability and potential for empirical testing.

## 10. Open Questions
- What are the implications of variations in parameters on the inner product?
- How can this model be extended to other spiritual practices?

**Reflection on Model Limitations:** We acknowledge that formalizing the Infinite (Ein Sof) involves inherent reductionism. This model is intended as a map, not the territory—a tool for resolving textual contradictions rather than a claim to capture the Divine essence fully. The mathematical framework serves as a hermeneutic device for understanding relationships between theological concepts, not as a complete ontological description.
