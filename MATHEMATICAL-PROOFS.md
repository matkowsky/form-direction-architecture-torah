## 1. Construction of Hilbert Space H = L²(Ω,μ) with Proof of Completeness  
To demonstrate that L²(Ω,μ) is a Hilbert space, we need to show that it is complete.  
**Proof:**  
Let {f_n} be a Cauchy sequence in L²(Ω,μ). By the properties of measure spaces, we know  ... 

## 2. Explicit Inner Product Construction with W, I, C, D, N  
Define the inner product as  
$$\langle f, g \rangle = \int_{\Omega} f(x) g(x) dμ(x)$$  
where W is ...
