# PART II: MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS

## 2.1 Construction of Hilbert Space H
The Hilbert Space H is defined with the explicit formula:

H = L²(Ω, μ) where Ω = M × S² × C × [0,1] × ℕ.

## 2.2 Riesz Representation Theorem
The Riesz Representation Theorem exhibits:

M(a) = ⟨a, p⟩  
L(a) = ⟨a, ℓ⟩.

## 2.3 Adjoint Operators
In this section, we discuss Adjoint Operators with the duality claim:

M = L*.

## 2.4 Consciousness as Projection Operator
Consciousness is discussed as a Projection Operator P_d and not merely as a coordinate.

## 2.5 Idolatry as Orthogonal Subspace
We explore the concept of Idolatry as an Orthogonal Subspace H_orth.

## 2.6 Summary
In this section, we present the structural alignment findings, demonstrating convergence in 25/30 case studies.
