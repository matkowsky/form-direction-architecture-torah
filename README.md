# Overview

## Abstract
This repository contains a scholarly paper addressing the four-century theological tension between Maharal of Prague's teleological ontology and Lurianic Kabbalistic emanational cosmology through a novel mathematical-mystical synthesis using Hilbert space theory. The framework achieves 83% empirical convergence across 30 halakhic test cases. For the complete abstract, see [ABSTRACT.md](ABSTRACT.md).
