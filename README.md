## Abstract
This repository contains a scholarly paper addressing the four-century theological tension between Maharal of Prague's teleological ontology and Lurianic Kabbalistic emanational cosmology through a novel mathematical-mystical synthesis using Hilbert space theory. The framework demonstrates structural consistency across 30 halakhic case studies. For the complete abstract, see [ABSTRACT.md](ABSTRACT.md).
