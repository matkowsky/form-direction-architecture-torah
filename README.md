# Overview

## Abstract
This repository contains a scholarly paper addressing the four-century theological tension between Maharal of Prague's teleological ontology and Lurianic Kabbalistic emanational cosmology through a novel mathematical-mystical synthesis using Hilbert space theory and matched asymptotic expansions. The framework demonstrates high structural consistency with 83% predictive accuracy across 30 halakhic test cases. For the complete abstract, see [ABSTRACT.md](ABSTRACT.md).
